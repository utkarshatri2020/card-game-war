Java Final project

This is a program simulating the Card Game called "War", where the player who has a card with higher number wins. 
You could run it by starting two Client instances and one multithreadserver instance. 
When you first start the client process, click "Open Connection". 
Once you are ready to play, click "Ready".
The game will wait until both players clicked "Ready" for each round to start a game.
The program handles clients exiting and new clients joining.
It also prevents more than two players from joining at the same time.
